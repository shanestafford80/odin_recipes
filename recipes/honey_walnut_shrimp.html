        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>Honey Walnut Shrimp is a classic dish from Hong Kong that many Americans 
            know about thanks to Panda Express and many other. The dish is popular 
            at many Chinese restaurants as well. Our version of this slightly sweet 
            dish more closely represents the fast food version. Ones you may find 
            in Hong Kong have very lightly battered shrimp whereas Panda Express has 
            a thicker and heavier coating for that extra crispy bite. We went somewhere 
            in between using cornstarch and egg to give it a nice and crispy coating. 
            The sugared walnuts are our favorite part and make the dish so unique!</p>
